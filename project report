RBDL test using the simple pendulum:
There are lots of unknown parameters when defining a robot model in the RBDL. Each robot needs to have a adequate
information regarding it's center of mass, mass, inertia values, rotation and orientation of each link of the robot
wrt the previous link, the rotation axis of the link. One of the unknowns were orientation of the base frame
in the RBDL. This information was crucial to us since the the translation and the rotation of the next link is dependent
of that value.
In order to test the RBDL library and test the output of the dynamics function generated by the library we have defined
a simple pendulum case as an input to the RBDL. Since the dynamics model of the simple pendulum is known to us, we can
easily compare the output of the RBDL with our model.
After the defining the pendulum link in the RBDL, and getting the results for the gravity matrix which is nothing but the
tau value(torque value) at the joint of the  link, it was evident that the base frame assignment in the RBDL library is such
that the +y-axis is pointing the up direction, the +x-axis is pointing the right direction and the +z-axis is coming out of the
paper.
The test on the pendulum was successful. The next step was to expand it in to a double rigid body pendulum. The system that was considered for this test was the same as the one described in the
course lecture. The result derived from the RBDL matched with the results obtained from the handwritten dynamics model of the same system from the course lecture (textbook).
